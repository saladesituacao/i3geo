    Want to help StoryMapJS be available in other languages? Here's how:
        * Fork the GitHub repository
        * Copy this file to a new file named xx.js where 'xx' is the two-letter ISO language code
        *   (or if a variant is involved, hyphenated as in zh-cn and zh-tw for two versions of Chinese)
        * delete these comments!
        * commit your new copy and push it to your GitHub fork
        * submit a pull request at https://github.com/NUKnightLab/StoryMapJS/pulls

    NOTE: English translations are primarily drawn from source/js/language/VCO.Language.js, not this file.
          This file is intended as a bootstrap for translators.
